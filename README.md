# Midterm-430

1. Sprint 1: UI/UX Developer:
 * To be completely honest during this sprint I did not what was going on. I did not realize that we had started the project in general, I was thrown off course because I fell behind here.
 I do not blame anyone but myself during this Sprint 1.  Have nothing to show for this sprint but to explain how after this I communicated better with my group. Thankfully, my group gave 
 me another chance and taught me how to communicate better when I was lacking knowledge on a concept. I feel incredibly fortunate to have such a great time to help me stay on track, since
  I have ADHD and anxiety it is very difficult to organize a project as large as this . My group members have been wonderful with understanding my learning disability and how I have trouble 
  finishing large tasks because I lose focus easily. Chris has been the best teammate by encouraging me to try even when I was wrong and helping me get through the tough time
	Sprint one taught me to communicate better and stay more organized especially when your team is counting on you to finish something. After this sprint I became more engaged
	 and in tune with what was going in my group. I am very thankful they were concerned about me and tried their best to help me. They reminded me this was a group effort and there will 
	 be many obstacles in place. After this Chris, helped me set up my trello, slack, and AWS account I was very thankful for him. After this sprint I was more vocal with what
	  I needed help with. I am very thankful to call team five my group. I just wanted to own up to my underperformance that I have been working on.
	  
2. Sprint 2 IT Operations:
*This was a difficult time for me since I did not understand AWS and had to constantly keep asking Chris questions. I was able to complete a login which allowed me to finally contribute
 to the team. This sprint was important for me since I had to prove myself to my team and I did not want to disappoint them again, so I tried my best to remain focused 
 and communicate better. Especially, since I had never aws or coded in php I had to keep asking Chris questions. Thankfully he sat down and helped me install everything
  and showed me the way. He made me feel more comfortable with my lack of skills as long as I kept trying he said I could be a team player. I wanted to show that during 
  this sprint I would not let them my team down, because of self esteem and anxiety problems that keep haunting me throughout the semester. I do not want to use that as 
  an excuse, but againt I’d like to mention how team five has helped me overcome this. They have been very understanding with my skills since I am not as advanced as they 
  are in some languages. During this sprint there were many tasks in operations I could not do since I lacked the advanced knowledge, so Chris was senior IT operations and he
   helped with setting up what I needed. He even told me what I needed to do and walked me step by step. Him and I have lab together for another class and he even stayed past our class
    to help me with my sprint. I am very blessed with having such supportive teammates so have been helping me with what I need. He reached out to me through slack and text, so I am very glad. 
    Sprint 2 was a milestone for me because I felt like I was learning more and understanding the project more.

3. Sprint 3: Project manager
* Sprint 3, was a very short sprint since it felt very rushed. Being project manger I had to make sure that are tasks were short and simple because we did not have enough time to 
accomplish the large tasks we needed. I listened to the individuals in our group that were well knowledge and heard out their concerns. I made sure to make the trello cards very
 descriptive and checked in with my groupmates when needed. This sprint one of our group members had a death in the family and I had to make sure to move some of his tasks around.
  It was an obstacle our group faced and I had to deal with the issue and treat it like in the real world. I was very understanding with the team member and had him finish what he could,
   and assigned him a smaller task. Since he was in mourning half of our sprint. One thing that was great is that are group was very understanding and was supportive of our group member.
	This obstacle showed me that are team works well and helps each other. This is a team effort and we care about how we are doing. We want to make sure everyone has time and is doing 
	well. During this Sprint I made sure to communicate everyone’s tasks clearly and made some accommodations for some individuals. Also, made sure to make a detail report and have
	 a midterm report as well. I made two reports just to outline what our team has accomplished. This will give us an idea of what we have left to do in the second half of the semester. 
	 So our group midterm report will allow our group to access what we as a group have accomplished.
